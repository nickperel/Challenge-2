            <p>
                My name is Nicholas Perel and I am an aspiring software engineer. In January of 2021, I received my bachelor's degree from Rutgers University with a Major in Criminal Justice and a Double Minor in Psychology and Political Science.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Following my graduation, I began to be trained in the art of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), receiving a certification of completion for an 8 week program in MBSR, as well as the completion of a 5 day silent retreat. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mindfulness and meditations are both great passions of mine, but after many hours of contemplation on what I really wanted to do with my life, I became aware of this Coding Bootcamp opportunity and decided to give it a try. Now, here I am today, fully buckled in for the ride it will take to be able to secure the title of Software Engineer for myself one day in the near future! :)
