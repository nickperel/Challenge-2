# Challenge 2: Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

I was tasked with creating a website from scratch with no starter code. This website is supposed to be a Professional Portfolio that will showcase my work that I have created over time as a developer. The criteria that had to be met was that I needed a functioning navigation bar, sections for an about me, my work and a contact me section. All links needed to be functioning properly, and any application image that is clicked on should take you to the deployed link of that application. This website also needed to have a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
